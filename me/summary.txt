My name is Alex Rabinovich. I'm an R&D Group Leader, software engineer, AI enthusiast, and fintech specialist. Originally from Kishinev, Moldova, I made my way to Israel at the age of 4, and Israel has been home ever since. I'm based in Israel, where I lead three engineering teams spread across Israel, Africa, and Europe, keeping global payments infrastructure running smoothly for people in 160+ countries.

I have 11+ years in software development and 7+ years in management, and technology is something I genuinely love rather than just work in. I am a problem solver at heart and I'm an AI enthusiast, practitioner and engineer, and I use AI every single day, not just as a buzzword, but in a real, hands-on way. I lead POCs, shape AI integration strategy, support architecture decisions, and think carefully about where and how AI actually adds business value, continuously deepening my expertise in how these systems are designed, evaluated, and deployed to increase team velocity. At work we're actively building and pushing AI into production-grade systems. On the cloud side, I'm an AWS Solutions Architect with solid, practical knowledge of cloud infrastructure and it's the backbone of everything we build.

My technical toolkit is broad and battle-tested. I design and build distributed systems using Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, and high-availability patterns. I'm fluent across multiple languages and frameworks including Go, Java, PHP, Node.js, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Angular, and VueJS. On the data side, I work comfortably across MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. I lead with Agile/Scrum, OKRs, and strong engineering governance, from sprint planning and incident management through to technical recruiting and budget ownership. I am more backend oriented but I deeply understand the user journey experience and its importance.

Outside of work, I'm a pretty active person. I grew up swimming competitively at a professional level in high school, and that drive to stay in shape never left me. These days you'll find me in the gym or when the season is right on a snowboard. Snowboarding is a real passion of mine, and winter sports in general are where I truly unwind.

I love spending time with friends, some of whom I've known since I was five years old, sharing good laughs and a cold beer. I enjoy a good Marvel movie every now and then, and Rick and Morty is genuinely one of my favorites. I also love to cook, whether it's putting together something special for an occasional dinner or just surprising the family on a regular Saturday morning. When it comes to food, I've always leaned toward fruit over chocolate, and if you ever want to win me over, Sushi is the way to go. Speaking of family, I'm married to Jenny, who runs her own insurance and financial planning business, and together we have three beautiful kids: Maya, Ben, and little Eden. They're my greatest motivation for everything I do.

Am I open to relocation? The honest answer is yes, if the right opportunity comes along. I'm not jumping on a plane tomorrow, but I'm also not the kind of person who closes doors before even seeing what's behind them. The right role, the right team, and the right challenge have a way of making geography a lot more flexible.

I speak Hebrew, English, and Russian fluently, which comes in handy when coordinating distributed teams across multiple continents and time zones.
